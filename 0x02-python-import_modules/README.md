# Tasks Summary

## Task 0: Import a simple function from a simple file

- Write a program (`0-add.py`) that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py`.
- Print the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3 using the imported function.
- Use print function with string format to display integers.
- Assign the value 1 to a variable called `a` and the value 2 to a variable called `b`.
- Print: `<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>` followed by a new line.

## Task 1: My first toolbox!

- Write a program (`1-calculation.py`) that imports functions from `calculator_1.py`, performs Maths operations, and prints the result.
- Use the imported functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Define the values 10 and 5 to variables `a` and `b`.
- Call each imported function with `a` and `b`, displaying the output as specified.

## Task 2: How to make a script dynamic!

- Create a program (`2-args.py`) that prints the number of arguments and lists the arguments passed to it.
- Display the number of arguments and list them with their position and value.

## Task 3: Infinite addition

- Write a program (`3-infinite_add.py`) that prints the result of the addition of all arguments passed to it.
- Cast arguments into integers using `int()` and print the sum.

## Task 4: Who are you?

- Create a program (`4-hidden_discovery.py`) that prints all names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
- Print names in alphabetical order, excluding names starting with `__`.

## Task 5: Everything can be imported

- Write a program (`5-variable_load.py`) that imports the variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

**Note:** Each task should execute as specified in the respective descriptions and adhere to the constraints mentioned.
